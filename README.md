# Python.ImageEncoder
Encode secret messages in .bmp images

Because I can't get my head around jpg compression and it often leads to
them behaving oddly, this program seems better suited to uncompressed images.
Admmittedly this is far less useful in the wild but will still allow me to
practice some steganography. It will be best to use bmp images here
